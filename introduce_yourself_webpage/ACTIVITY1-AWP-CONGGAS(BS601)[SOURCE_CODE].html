				<h1>ASK ME ANYTHING!</h1>

				<h2>Why did you choose Computer Science?</h2>
				<p>
					Initially, I thought <abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Computer Science">BSCS</abbr> mostly covers all about programming.
					While it is true in the long run, little did I know that it is not all about programming. but also learning about how systems and software are formulated and developed throughout various stages. 
					Also, I think I took this course because the skills I need should suffice
					to take on my dream job: being a game developer (well, an indie game developer at least).
				</p>
				<br/>
				
				<h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
				<p>
					To be a game developer. I believe BSCS has the necessary subjects that would involve
					game programming and game development in general.
				</p>
				<br/>
				
				<h2>What are your expectations regarding the subject?</h2>
				<p>
					My expectation/s upon learning this subject is/are to grasp more about
					developing websites through Visual Basic. The subject expects me to use
					Visual Basic not only for creating webpages but also server hosting
					and maintaining website integrity in the long run.
